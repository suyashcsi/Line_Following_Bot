# Line_Following_Bot
A Line Follower Robot, as the name suggests, is an automated guided vehicle, which follow a visual line embedded on the floor or ceiling. Usually, 
the visual line is the path in which the line follower robot goes and it will be a black line on a white surface but the other way 
(white line on a black surface) is also possible.

Concept of working of line follower is related to light. We use here the behavior of light at black and white surface. When light fall on a 
white surface it is almost full reflected and in case of black surface light is completely absorbed. This behavior of 
light is used in building a line follower robot.
